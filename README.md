# NER Application with Jenkins Pipelines and Docker

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and configurations for a Named Entity Recognition (NER) application. The application leverages Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines, Docker for containerization, and Google Compute Engine for deployment.

## Features

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** The core functionality of the application is to identify named entities (such as names of persons, organizations, locations, etc.) within text inputs.
  
- **Jenkins Pipelines:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are defined using Jenkins to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
  
- **Docker:** The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments and ease of deployment.
  
- **Google Compute Engine:** Deployment scripts and configurations for deploying the Dockerized application to Google Compute Engine are provided.

## Requirements

To run and deploy the NER application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Jenkins
- Google Cloud SDK (for deploying to Google Compute Engine)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
```

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t ner-app .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 ner-app
Access the application:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to use the NER application.

Jenkins Pipelines
The Jenkins pipelines are configured to:

Build: Automatically build the Docker image whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Test: Run unit tests and ensure code quality standards are met.
Deploy: Automatically deploy the application to Google Compute Engine upon successful build and tests.
To set up Jenkins pipelines for this project, refer to the Jenkinsfile in the repository and configure your Jenkins server accordingly.

Deployment to Google Compute Engine
Deployment to Google Compute Engine involves the following steps:

Ensure Google Cloud SDK is installed and authenticated.
Modify the deployment scripts (deploy.sh, update.sh) with your specific project and instance details.
Execute the deployment scripts to deploy or update the Dockerized NER application on Google Compute Engine.
